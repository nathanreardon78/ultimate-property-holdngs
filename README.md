## System architecture

| Layer | Responsibilities |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Next.js App Router | Renders public pages and server components; hosts admin UI. |
| Prisma ORM | Data access, migrations, and type-safe client. |
| PostgreSQL | Persistent storage for properties, units, media, and maintenance tickets. |
| Amazon S3 | File storage for property/unit imagery and maintenance attachments. |
| JWT session | `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` auth with `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` signed cookie. |

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20
- pnpm (or npm/yarn) – repo uses pnpm
- PostgreSQL instance (Neon, RDS, etc.) reachable via `DATABASE_URL`
- Amazon S3 bucket + IAM credentials with `s3:PutObject`/`s3:DeleteObject`

## Getting started

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma:generate

# push schema to your PostgreSQL database (creates tables)
pnpm db:push

# start local dev server
pnpm dev
```

---

## Database schema



![Database Schema](docs/uph-db-schema.png)

Key entities:

- `Property` with hero image, amenities, and optional geo coordinates.
- `PropertyImage` ordered gallery images linked to a property.
- `Unit` with availability flags, pricing, and optional cover image.
- `UnitImage` additional ordered media per unit.
- `MaintenanceRequest` storing tenant submissions (with optional attachment).

---

## Development scripts

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start Next.js dev server with hot reload. |
| `pnpm build` | Production build (Turbopack). |
| `pnpm start` | Run production build locally. |
| `pnpm prisma:generate` | Regenerate Prisma client. |
| `pnpm db:push` | Apply Prisma schema changes to the database. |

---

## Admin workflow

1. Browse to `/admin/login` and authenticate using `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
2. Dashboard (`/admin`) lists all properties with availability snapshots and quick actions.
3. Use `/admin/create` wizard to add new properties (hero image + optional units).  
   - Uploads go directly to S3; generated URLs + keys are stored in the DB.
4. `/admin/edit/[id]` allows:
   - Updating hero image & gallery.
   - Editing core metadata and amenity lists.
   - Adding/removing units, toggling availability/waitlist, hiding/reactivating units.
   - Uploading per-unit cover/gallery and cleaning up assets.
5. Logout via the **Sign out** button in the admin header (clears the signed cookie).

---

## Maintenance intake

- Public `/maintenance` page contains the online request form.
- Submissions hit `POST /api/maintenance`, saving data to `MaintenanceRequest`.
- Optional photo/video uploads are stored in S3 with stored object keys for auditing.
- Admin reporting endpoints can be added later (e.g., `/admin/maintenance`) to display/request status changes.
